        <img src="images/brad.jpg">
        <p>This is Brad, a three week old mature Sourdough starter. Our lowest maintenance roommate by far. He's a little temperamental, but we love him nonetheless.<p>

      <div>
        <img src="images/plants.jpg">
        <p>This is Fig Tree, and his son, Fig Sapling. Contrary to their name, these will not produce figs. Also, Fig Sapling is not really Fig Tree's son, he's more like his brother as they both stem from the same source tree!<p> 
      </div> <!-- Fact #2 -->

      <div>
        <img src="images/leafbubby.jpg">
        <p>These are our leaf insects, a type of phasmid known for their leaf-like appearance. When threatened, they wiggle their bums energetically to simulate leaves in the wind. :  ) <p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm Erin, a first year ICS student at Camosun curently living in my second home: Sweden. I love to travel and experience new things to the point where all of my income goes towards plane tickets. I'm also a beast of a cook, my repertoire is gigantic and daily variety is what I strive for. As you can probably tell by this website, I really like cats. My own cat's name is Cream, and she lives with my parents back in Victoria. When I was a kid, my dream was to be a veterinarian so I could be with animals all day. I've strayed a bit from that goal now but creating a website with random cat themed things I found on Google probably makes up for it. There are a few other hobbies I have that I'm really passionate about, like reading fantasy novels, playing indie video games, and listening to Scandinavian power metal. I love anything that can transport me into a completely different world, no matter the medium.</p>
        <p>Some fun facts about me:
          <ol>
          <li>I have never broken a bone in my life</li>
          <li>I've legally changed my name a total of two times</li>
          <li>I'm functionally bilingual, I can read perfectly in a third language (never learned to speak it), and I'm working on a fourth</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website and reading about my life!</p>
